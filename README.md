## Technical Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

The API stack is built using ASP.NET Core Web API, following RESTful principles. It ensures security, scalability, and user-friendly interactions for student billing operations.

## Project Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Install Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code with the ASP.NET Core workload.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the solution file (`StudentBillingAPI.sln`) in Visual Studio or the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
4. Set up the database by running the necessary database scripts provided separately.
5. Update the database connection string in the `appsettings.json` file to point to your database.
6. Build the solution to resolve dependencies.
7. Run the application by pressing F5 or using `dotnet run` command in the terminal.
